FastAPI is a modern and fast web framework (high performance) for building APIs with Python, based on Type Hints, Pydantic, and Starlette.

The main features are:

* Fast: Extremely high performance, comparable to NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

* Fast to code: Increase development speed by about 200% to 300%.

* Fewer bugs: Reduce human (developer) induced errors by approximately 40%.

* Intuitive: Excellent editor support. Autocompletion everywhere. Less debugging time.

* Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time spent reading documentation.

* Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer errors.

* Robust: Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.

* Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
